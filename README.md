Itcoatl is an Aztec themed snake game made to test drive my engine Pixiretro. It features a main menu and a high scorer's leaderboard as well as the game itself. The gameplay consists of eating as many nuggets as you can as quickly as you can, gaining score bonuses for speed and nugget combos, and has 8 playable snakes each named after an Aztec emperor.
