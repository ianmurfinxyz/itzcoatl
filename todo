[06-04-2021]
- [nah! prefer the non-smooth movement and made it the default anyway] investigate the visual 
  anomaly when wrapping in which the smooth moving segments appear to seperate, it must be a 
  side effect of the wrap logic combined with the draw lerping.
- [DONE] draw a background
- [DONE] add some nuggets to eat
- [SKIP] idea for scoring: can make different nuggets last for different durations, shorter lived 
  nuggets can be worth more points, and can gain bonus points for collecting nuggets in quick
  succession. Thus the goal is to collect as many nuggets as fast as possible, prioritising
  those nuggets which are more valuable whilst balancing this against those which are closer.
  Since if a valuable nugget is far away you may want to beeline for it to get the score, but
  doing so may break your combo.
- [DONE] will want a UI/HUD that shows the combo timer and your score.
- [DONE but without the score unlock] could unlock more snakes to play as by gaining higher scores.
- [skip] like the idea of gold piling up on the edges of the map (outside the map) as you collect
  more points.
- [skip] could also add power up nuggets which give you a boost to speed to help with combos.
- [DONE] add a cracking music score - some aztec themed stuff.
- sound effect for score/eating and dying etc.
- [DONE MENU - DO SCORES] menu and score reg/board states (no splash state).
- [DONE] strip out the old openal sfx module and replace it with a sdl_mixer module, the latter is 
  simpler to use and easier to install and distribute so people downloading the game will have
  an easier time compiling it. I also seem to have problems getting openal running on my system
  and don't want the headache.


- [DONE] add some LittleRobotSoundFactory music loops:

https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/18177/?page=2#sound
jungle war drums mix seems like it would go well
https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/18000/

ancient people loop suits really well, use this one,
https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/320998/

- [DONE] add a music mixer module which will fade in/out a sequence of music loops.
- [decided not to do this] the nuggets need to flash and time out.
- [DONE] think I need more nuggets so should increase the spawn number.
- [DONE] detect snake eating itself.
- implement the flow of the play scene - do I want to instantly switch to another scene upon
  death or do a death state where some animtion or something plays? or maybe even just a short
  delay?
- [DONE] have added a blood block so when the snake bites itself I can sever the snake at that point,
  clear a few blocks either side, and set the ends to the blood block. Then spray out some
  nuggets via a particle like effect. Implement this!

- [actually don't, keep the build super simple, and keep a local copy of the engine so I  dont 
  have to worry about changes in the master branch breaking this game] once pixiretro engine is 
  done compile it into a library and link against it.

[17-04-2021]
- [DONE] organise the project files.
- [DONE] tweak the menu to make small improvements - center the snake names, make the black snake box a
  little bigger etc.
- [DONE] finish readme, need sections: menu, controls, compilation, add all attributes for sounds used.
- [DONE] get the game compiling on ubuntu

[TO DO LATER]
- add the score states
- get the game compiling on windows.
- add sounds to the game state, specifically add a sound (like a dong?) when the speed timer 
  drops to zero. Add a sound when snake changes direction? Happens too often so would this be
  annoying? Perhaps a really subtle thud or tap.
- have the game state switch back to the menu upon death or even better the high score states.
- add a youtube demonstration of the project on my (currently empty) pixrex channel.
- make it possible to dynamically resize the window during play. This is entirely possible to do
  with my renderer which can handle this no problem by auto resizing the virtual pixels. I think it
  is currently being prevented due to the SDL flags I am passing to the create window function. Investigate!
- setup a better music sequence for the game state, don't like the current one, the repeating dong noise is
  annoying. Try the ancient people loop combined with the jungle drums and have each loop run longer.
